nuclide-atom-npm\n\nPackage to register Atom-specific Node packages.\n\nThis global registry prevents Node packages from triggering side effects\nmultiple times (e.g. adding stylesheets, registering keybindings). Note that\nthis also prevents different Atom packages from using different versions of the\nNode package.\n\n## Register a Node package\n\nThe first argument is the root path of your package's code (the path to `lib/`).\n\nThe second argument is the path to what you'd normally put in `main.js`. This\nvalue also functions as a key -- calling `require()` on the package will return\nthe first package that was registered with this key.\n\nThis approach prevents Node from having to evaluate the implementation multiple\ntimes and allows it to load resources from `styles/`, `keymaps/`, `menus/`, etc.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = require('nuclide-atom-npm').load(__dirname, 'AtomInput');\n```\n\n## Use the Node package\n\nAdd the dependency in `package.json` as usual:\n```js\n{\n  \"name\": \"nuclide-buck-toolbar\",\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"atom\": \">0.193.0\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"nuclide-ui-atom-input\": \"0.0.0\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRequire the package as usual:\n```js\nvar AtomInput = require('nuclide-ui-atom-input');\n\nmodule.exports = React.createClass({\n  render() {\n    return <AtomInput />;\n  },\n});\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"fb","email":"poshannessy@fb.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-07-06T19:59:07.055Z","created":"2015-05-22T05:24:59.719Z","0.0.0":"2015-05-22T05:24:59.719Z","0.0.2":"2015-05-31T20:02:03.015Z","0.0.5":"2015-05-31T21:18:49.954Z","0.0.6":"2015-06-01T04:20:52.295Z","0.0.10":"2015-06-07T13:54:05.264Z","0.0.12":"2015-06-10T19:54:32.991Z","0.0.13":"2015-06-10T20:17:26.860Z","0.0.14":"2015-06-10T20:22:08.284Z","0.0.15":"2015-06-15T02:15:04.708Z","0.0.18":"2015-06-22T19:33:11.102Z","0.0.19":"2015-06-23T00:59:01.604Z","0.0.20":"2015-06-23T02:21:15.040Z","0.0.21":"2015-06-23T16:49:25.443Z","0.0.22":"2015-06-26T03:53:41.164Z","0.0.23":"2015-07-06T19:12:26.399Z","0.0.24":"2015-07-06T19:59:07.055Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebook/nuclide","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/facebook/nuclide"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"3DU4S0HIMF3P4ULTRPMRVR7IU\""}
