If you have\n`ssh-agent` set up for your remote server, you can select \"Use ssh-agent\". If you\nhave RSA key pair set up between your local machine and your remote server, you\ncan specify the file path to your private key.\n\n**Caveat**: if your private key is encrypted, please add it to your ssh-agent by\ncalling `ssh-add` and select \"Use ssh-agent\".\n\nLastly, specify the remote server command to where it is installed to.\n`nuclide-start-server` will pick an open port from a predefined list. If your\nremote server has specific port that shall be used, you can append port number\nto the command. For example,`nuclide-start-server -p 9090`\n\nUpon submtting the connect dialog, Nuclide will try to establish an SSH connection\nto your remote server, and run `nuclide-start-server` command to start Nuclide\nserver if it is not running.\n\n# Security\nEach Nuclide server instance generates key pair and client certificate for remote\nconnection. As part of SSH handshake, the client receives the private key and\ncertificate. The private key is encrypted and saved in Atom project state together\nwith the certificate. The encrypting key is stored in key store (such as key chain\non osx) by using [keytar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keytar).\nUsing the certificate and private key, Nuclide client establishes a remote\nconnection over HTTPS or/and WSS (WebSockets over SSL/TLS) with remote server.\n\n# Remote Projects\nOn top of the remote connection, Nuclide creates and adds a remote project in the\nfile tree. Remote projects will survive Nuclide reload and restart in that they will\nappear in the file tree automatically. You can add multiple remote projects on the\nsame server. The current caveat is that you have to go through the SSH connection\nagain for a second remote project on the same remote server.\n\nYou can remove remote projects from the context menu of file tree. When you try to\nremove the last remote project on a remote server, you will get prompted asking\nwhether you want to shutdown the Nuclide server on your remote server. Shutting down\nthe Nuclide server invalidates its certificates and keys.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-remote-projects/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-remote-projects","_id":"nuclide-remote-projects@0.0.24","_shasum":"58e378bab4ce14620a78fe3e7554f0f0b32baefb","_resolved":"file:../d-11569-7400-1itax1o/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11569-7400-1itax1o/package.tgz"}
